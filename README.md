# SmartMirror
# A personal assistant system behind the mirror
A system that is developed to help managing the daily activities like managing the appointments
for the day, understanding the weather forecast for the day and some following days,
synchronizing the calendar with the mirror. The concept of the system is to display the clock,
current weather and weather forecast of following days, etc on a screen that has been fitted
behind a home mirror. The user can control the system using voice commands, thus making the
system hands free. The mirror can also be used for entertainment purposes like displaying
YouTube videos of our choice just by providing voice commands. The system is based out of a
raspberry pi board and few other peripheral parts like a microphone, speaker, mirror etc.

	Clock:

	sudo apt-get install npm
	npm install moment --save
